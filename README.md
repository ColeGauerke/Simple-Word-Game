# Simple-Word-Game
This is a word guessing game where the user is dealt a hand of letters and has to create words using those letters. This project idea was given to be from MIT OpenCourseWare and I used the 'assignment' to practice my python skills
The main element of this project is impleneting functions, and list and dictionary manipulation
